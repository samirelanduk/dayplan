# Dayplan

An app for working out how much work per hour needs to be done to meet daily targets.

## Run

```bash
PORT=3000 npm run dev # Replace with port of your choice
```

## Use

Specify what you want the working period to be with the datetime controls - this will determine how much time you have left.

Specify how many minutes of work there are remaining in as many categories as you like with the columns below - this will determine the average minutes of work per hour of time remaining, at any given time.

The state will persist when the app is closed - use the reset button to clear.
